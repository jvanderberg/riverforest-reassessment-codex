# Civic Geo-Data Explorer Recipe

## Summary

A recipe for building a single-page civic data explorer that overlays one or
more **public records datasets** onto a **map of a defined jurisdiction**,
lets visitors **filter**, **search**, and **summarize** the dataset, and
produces a shareable URL that captures the current view.

Use this recipe when you have a finite, geocoded population — properties on a
tax roll, schools in a district, restaurant inspections in a city, permits in
a ZIP — and you want a fast, static, mobile-friendly site that:

- combines a **tabular records dataset** (the primary entities and their
  attributes) with
- a **geospatial parcel/boundary layer** (polygons or points to draw), and
- a **coordinate/address reference** (so records that don't carry lat/lon can
  still be placed on a map),
- joining them by a stable identifier (PIN, license number, school ID, etc.)
  so the map, summary tables, and search all stay in sync.

A worked example threaded through the Data Sources section applies the
pattern to Cook County, IL property reassessments — annual market
values overlaid on parcel geometry, with year-over-year change as the
headline metric. The pattern transfers to any jurisdiction with
equivalent public datasets.

## App Stack

**Delivery model: pure static.** The deployed app is a directory of
static files — HTML, JS, CSS, and pre-built JSON/GeoJSON data —
served by any CDN or static host. There is no runtime database, no
API server, and no backend. All data work happens at build time in a
Node extract step that fetches from upstream sources (or reads from
a local cache of them), normalizes the records, and writes the
JSON/GeoJSON files the browser will fetch on first load. The build
pipeline runs in one direction: upstream public APIs → optional
local SQLite cache (build machine only, never deployed) → Node
extract script → static JSON + GeoJSON in the Vite `public/`
directory → Vite build → static site on a CDN. If you can deploy a
folder of HTML, you can deploy this app.

Keep the stack small and use the latest stable versions that interoperate:

- **Build/runtime**: Vite + TypeScript, React 19, Node 20+ for the
  extract pipeline.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`), `tw-animate-css`
  for keyframes, `@fontsource-variable/geist` for typography, `clsx` +
  `tailwind-merge` for class composition.
- **Components**: shadcn/ui on Radix primitives, `lucide-react` for icons,
  `class-variance-authority` for variants. Vendor the shadcn components
  into a local `components/ui/` directory so they can be tweaked in
  place rather than imported from a package.
- **State**: **Zustand** for app-wide state — filters, selected legend bins,
  highlighted record, theme, URL-serialized view. Prefer one store with
  selector slices over deep `useState` trees and prop drilling. Use local
  `useState` only for component-local UI like input focus or popover open
  state.
- **Map**: Leaflet + `react-leaflet`, CARTO light/dark basemap tiles,
  canvas renderer for marker-heavy views.
- **Geo math**: `@turf/*` (union, point-in-polygon, helpers, buffer) in
  the extract step — keep heavy geometry work out of the browser.
- **Data pipeline (build-time only)**: a Node script that fetches the
  source APIs (or reads them from a local cache), normalizes records,
  and writes static JSON + GeoJSON into the Vite `public/` directory.
  `better-sqlite3` for reading the optional local cache. None of this
  ships to the client — the deployed bundle never opens a database
  or hits a query API.
- **Quality**: Biome for lint + format (tabs, single quotes), TypeScript
  strict, and a single `check` / `check:fix` npm script that wraps
  lint + format + typecheck so contributors only learn one command.
- **Deploy**: static hosting (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, S3+CDN). No
  server, no API at runtime — the extract step is the backend.

## Style Guide

### Theme

- **Light + dark**, driven by the user's `prefers-color-scheme`. Add a
  `dark` class to `<html>` and set `color-scheme` so native form controls
  follow. Persist user overrides in the URL or store, not localStorage,
  so a shared link looks the same on the recipient's screen.
- Color tokens are declared as **OKLCH** CSS variables on `:root` and
  `.dark`, then exposed to Tailwind via `@theme inline`. Use
  `--background`, `--foreground`, `--muted`, `--border`, `--primary`,
  `--accent`, `--destructive`, plus `--chart-1…5` for data viz. Never
  hardcode hex values in components — go through the variable.
- The map basemap, polygon outlines, and highlight markers all branch on
  the same `isDarkMode` flag so the dark theme stays cohesive across
  Leaflet and the chrome.

### Typography & spacing

- One variable font (Geist) loaded via `@fontsource-variable`. One family
  is enough; use weight + size for hierarchy.
- Density tier: `text-xs` for tables and filters, `text-sm` for
  headings/buttons, `text-base` for hero numbers. Avoid more than three
  sizes per pane.
- Radius scale derived from one `--radius` variable
  (`--radius-sm` … `--radius-4xl`).

### Component templates

- **Surfaces**: `rounded-md border border-border bg-background/95
  shadow-sm` for floating panels (legend, mobile stat cards). Drop the
  `/95` when the panel is opaque.
- **Tables**: sticky `<thead>` with `bg-muted`, `border-b border-border`
  between rows, right-aligned numeric columns, secondary metric (e.g.
  percent) rendered in `text-muted-foreground` directly under the
  primary metric.
- **Filter sections**: collapsible header (`ChevronRight` rotates 90°
  when open), an "All / None" pair on the right, and a scrollable
  `max-h-44 overflow-y-auto` body with checkbox + label rows. Show
  `selected / total` counts next to the section title.
- **Buttons**: shadcn variants — `default`, `outline`, `secondary`,
  `ghost`. Active toggles use `default`, inactive use `outline`.
- **Badges**: use for compact counts (e.g. `displayed / total`).
- **Map popups & tooltips**: restyled via `.leaflet-container .leaflet-…`
  selectors to read from the same `--popover`, `--border`,
  `--foreground` tokens so they don't look pasted in.

### Mobile

- Layout in `dvh` units so the iOS toolbar doesn't crop content.
- Sidebar/filter pane is a slide-in drawer on `<md`, a static column on
  `≥md`. Provide an always-visible "Filters" rail tab when the drawer is
  closed so the affordance is discoverable.
- Duplicate the top-level KPIs as a floating two-column card on mobile
  so they remain visible when the drawer is closed.
- Map controls (zoom, legend) live in the bottom-right and bottom-left
  corners — thumb-reachable, never under the drawer trigger.
- Hit targets: 32px minimum (`size-8` / `py-1.5`). Tap-to-expand for
  clustered markers; never rely on hover.

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard nav**: every interactive element reachable in tab order,
  including legend swatches (they're already `<button>` — keep them
  that way) and marker popups (open with Enter, close with Esc). The
  map needs an "skip to map" anchor and arrow-key panning via
  Leaflet's built-in keyboard handler (enabled by default — don't
  disable it).
- **Focus rings**: use the existing `--ring` token; never strip
  `outline` without a replacement. shadcn components ship with
  `focus-visible:ring-2` — keep it.
- **ARIA**: label icon-only buttons (`aria-label="Open filters"`,
  `aria-label="Close filters"`, `aria-label="Clear search"`). Use
  `aria-expanded` on collapsible section headers and `aria-pressed` on
  any toggle button (legend filters, group-by switches, theme toggle).
- **Color is never the only cue**. Pick a **colorblind-safe divergent
  palette** for the legend — a 7-stop ColorBrewer-style ramp works
  well; verify it against deuteranopia and protanopia simulators
  before shipping. Pair color with a textual label in tooltips and a
  numeric range in the legend so the bin is legible without color.
- **Contrast**: text on every surface variable pair must clear WCAG AA
  (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large). Re-check after any OKLCH token
  tweak — it's easy to drop `--muted-foreground` below threshold.
- **Reduced motion**: gate the drawer slide, chevron rotate, and map
  fly-to behind `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`. Snap, don't
  animate, when the visitor has asked for less motion.

## Data Sources

Three categories of input feed the recipe. The worked example below
pulls all three from Cook County, IL public data services; each
source is documented with its portal page, the machine-readable
endpoint, the query mechanics, the schema fields the pattern relies
on, and the license/attribution — usable on its own as a reference,
and the pattern transfers to any equivalent municipal data sources.

Two source platforms recur and are worth knowing:

- **Socrata Open Data API (SODA)**. Tabular datasets on
  `datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov` and most US municipal portals. Each
  dataset has a 4x4 ID (e.g. `uzyt-m557`); the human page lives at
  `https://<host>/d/<id>` and the JSON endpoint at
  `https://<host>/resource/<id>.json`. Query with SoQL params:
  `$select`, `$where`, `$order`, `$limit` (default 1000, max
  50000), `$offset`. Send `X-App-Token: <token>` to lift throttling —
  register a free app token on the portal. Full field metadata and
  column types are on the dataset page's "Columns" tab and at
  `https://<host>/api/views/<id>.json`.
- **Esri ArcGIS REST FeatureServer / MapServer**. Geospatial layers
  exposed at `.../FeatureServer/<layerId>` or
  `.../MapServer/<layerId>`. Append `?f=pjson` to that URL to read
  the layer's full schema (field names, types, geometry type, spatial
  reference). Append `/query` and POST a form-encoded body with
  `where`, `outFields`, `outSR=4326`, `f=geojson`,
  `returnGeometry=true` to fetch features. Servers cap responses
  (commonly 1000–2000 features) — paginate with
  `resultOffset`/`resultRecordCount`, or batch your `where IN (…)`
  list into chunks of ~500 IDs.

### 1. Tabular records (the spine)

Three Socrata datasets from the Cook County Assessor on
`datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov`. Each is updated on the Assessor's
own cadence (assessed values: annually plus reassessment-cycle
updates; addresses: monthly-ish). License: public domain / open data
per the [Cook County Terms of
Use](https://www.cookcountyil.gov/terms-use).

**1a. Assessed Values** — annual market value, land + building +
total, at each assessment stage.

- Portal: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/d/uzyt-m557>
- JSON endpoint: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/resource/uzyt-m557.json>
- Schema fields the recipe uses (see portal Columns tab for full list):
  - `pin` (text, 14-digit Property Index Number — **join key**)
  - `year` (number)
  - `class` (text, 3-digit property class code)
  - `township_code`, `township_name`, `nbhd` (text — neighborhood code)
  - `mailed_bldg`, `mailed_land`, `mailed_tot`, `mailed_hie` (number)
  - `certified_bldg`, `certified_land`, `certified_tot`, `certified_hie`
  - `board_bldg`, `board_land`, `board_tot`, `board_hie`
- Query example (all 2026 values for one township, paginated):

  ```
  GET https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/resource/uzyt-m557.json
      ?$where=year=2026 AND township_code='10'
      &$limit=50000
  ```

- Stage selection: pick the latest non-null total per row — board →
  certified → mailed — so you always show the most up-to-date value
  for that PIN/year.

**1b. Parcel Addresses** — situs address and mailing address per
PIN, per year.

- Portal: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/d/3723-97qp>
- JSON endpoint: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/resource/3723-97qp.json>
- Schema fields used:
  - `pin` (text — **join key**)
  - `year` (number)
  - `prop_address_full`, `prop_address_city_name`,
    `prop_address_state`, `prop_address_zipcode_1` (text — situs)
  - `mail_address_name`, `mail_address_full`,
    `mail_address_city_name`, `mail_address_state`,
    `mail_address_zipcode_1` (text — mailing)

**1c. Property Classes** (lookup) — 3-digit class code to human
description (e.g. `203 = One story residence, any age, 1,001 to
1,800 sq. ft.`). The Assessor publishes this as a static reference
page rather than a Socrata dataset:

- Reference page:
  <https://www.cookcountyassessoril.gov/classifications-real-property>
- Treat it as a small embedded lookup: maintain a hand-curated JSON
  of `{ code: description }` pairs in your repo and join in memory.
  This list changes rarely (years between updates) and is small
  enough to commit.

**1d. Property Characteristics** (optional, for richer popups) —
square footage, year built, bedroom/bath counts per PIN-year per
improvement (building). Multiple rows per PIN-year when a parcel
has multiple buildings.

- Portal: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Single-and-Multi-Family-Improvement-Chara/x54s-btds>
- JSON endpoint: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/resource/x54s-btds.json>
- Schema fields commonly used in popups: `pin`, `year`, `card`
  (building number), `char_bldg_sf`, `char_yrblt`, `char_beds`,
  `char_fbath`, `char_hbath`, `char_class`.

### 2. Geospatial geometry (the picture)

Two ArcGIS FeatureServer layers from Cook County GIS.

**2a. Parcel polygons** — the property boundary geometry.

- Layer page: <https://gis.cookcountyil.gov/hosting/rest/services/Hosted/Parcel_2022/FeatureServer/0>
- Schema (full): <https://gis.cookcountyil.gov/hosting/rest/services/Hosted/Parcel_2022/FeatureServer/0?f=pjson>
- Query endpoint:
  <https://gis.cookcountyil.gov/hosting/rest/services/Hosted/Parcel_2022/FeatureServer/0/query>
- Join field: `name` (the 14-digit parcel PIN). Not every assessed
  PIN has a polygon — condos in particular share a building polygon
  under the parent PIN.
- Query mechanics: POST form-encoded
  `where=name IN ('14...','14...',...)&outFields=name&outSR=4326&f=geojson`
  in batches of ~500 PINs (URL length and server limits). Example:

  ```
  POST .../FeatureServer/0/query
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  where=name IN ('16071010010000','16071010020000','16071010030000')
  outFields=name
  outSR=4326
  f=geojson
  ```

- Output: GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`; each feature's
  `properties.name` is the PIN. Enrich each feature with the joined
  tabular fields so the browser doesn't need a second lookup.
- License: per Cook County GIS terms of use, attribution required.

**2b. Jurisdiction boundary** — one polygon describing the area
your app covers. Two practical paths, depending on what your
jurisdiction publishes:

- *Path A — published boundary layer*. Most municipalities publish
  their own ArcGIS portal (look for `<city>.hub.arcgis.com` or
  `<city>-open-data.hub.arcgis.com`). Find the layer titled
  "Municipal Boundary", "City Limits", or similar and grab its
  FeatureServer query URL — the layer page lists it under
  "I want to use this" → "View API resources". For the Cook County
  worked example, the Village of Oak Park portal lives at
  <https://oak-park-open-data-portal-v2-oakparkil.hub.arcgis.com>.
- *Path B — union of sub-features*. If no single boundary polygon
  is published (or the published one is awkward to query), fetch a
  layer of sub-features that tile the jurisdiction (historic
  districts, census tracts, ZIP polygons) and union them with
  [`@turf/union`](https://turfjs.org/docs/api/union) in the extract
  step. Query with `where=1=1` and `f=geojson`, then merge all
  features into one. Result: one `FeatureCollection` with a single
  feature. The Cook County worked example takes this path against
  the Village's Census Tracts layer:

  ```
  https://utility.arcgis.com/usrsvcs/servers/4cff1aaefa364b57b8c70d5c606f2088/rest/services/VOP/AGOL_VOP_Project/MapServer/159
  ```

  Query it with `?f=pjson` for the schema, or append `/query` and
  POST `where=1=1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson&returnGeometry=true`
  to fetch every tract polygon.
- Whichever path you take, **bake the source URL into the manifest**
  (see Provenance & freshness) so visitors can verify what they're
  looking at.

### 3. Coordinate reference (the bridge)

A PIN → (lat, lon) lookup, used when a record can't be matched to a
parcel polygon. In Cook County this is **Address Points**:

- Portal: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/d/78yw-iddh>
- JSON endpoint: <https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/resource/78yw-iddh.json>
- Schema fields used:
  - `pin` (text — join key)
  - `address` (text)
  - `city` (text — filter to your jurisdiction)
  - `lat`, `lon` (number, WGS84)
- Query example (all Oak Park points):

  ```
  GET https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/resource/78yw-iddh.json
      ?$where=upper(city)='OAK PARK'
      &$limit=50000
  ```

- Expect a single-digit percentage of records to need this fallback
  (condos, vacant land, exempt parcels — about 7% in the Cook
  County example). Compute the number at extract time and disclose
  it in your UI; don't hide it.

### Working copy: cache before you query

> **Build-time only.** The SQLite cache described here lives on the
> machine (or CI runner) that runs the extract step. It is **never
> shipped to the browser**, never deployed, never queried at runtime.
> The deployed app only sees the static JSON / GeoJSON files the
> extract step writes; the cache exists so those files can be
> rebuilt reliably without hammering upstream portals.

Hitting Socrata + ArcGIS from a build step is fine for small
datasets but fragile for anything county-scale. The recommended
pattern is a one-time bulk pull into a local SQLite file (hundreds
of MB at county scale) keyed by the join ID, with the extract step
reading from that cache instead of going back to the network on
every build:

- Bulk fetch script that pages through each Socrata dataset
  (`$limit=50000` + `$offset`) and inserts into SQLite tables named
  after the dataset.
- Refresh on a cron (weekly is plenty for slow-moving assessment-
  style data) — typically as a separate CI job from the site build.
- The Socrata `:updated_at` system field on each row lets you do
  incremental pulls: `$where=:updated_at > '<last_run_iso>'`.
- ArcGIS parcel geometry rarely changes — cache it for months.
- Keep the cache file out of the deployed bundle: list it in
  `.gitignore`, and never reference it from browser code.

For small datasets (a few thousand records) skip SQLite entirely —
the extract step can fetch from the upstream API directly on each
build. The cache is an optimization, not a requirement.

### Joining heterogeneous sources

Pick **one canonical identifier** per record (PIN here) and resolve
everything else through a deterministic fallback chain:

1. **Exact ID match** against the coordinate source.
2. **Parent ID match** — strip the unit suffix (`pin.substring(0, 10) +
   '0000'`) and look up the parent parcel. Critical for condo buildings
   where each unit has its own record but only the building has a
   geometry.
3. **Normalized address match** — uppercased, with street-type
   suffix-stripped, against an in-memory address map. Last-resort
   fallback for records whose IDs don't appear in any geometry source.
4. **Drop with a counter** — keep a per-method tally so you can
   report how many records were placed by each method and how many
   were dropped. Surface the dropped count in the UI (the data-source
   info popover is the natural home for it) instead of hiding it.

Write the joined output as **two static files** in the static-assets
directory:

- `records.json` — flat array of records, one per entity.
- `geometry.geojson` — `FeatureCollection` where each feature carries
  enough joined fields (address, class, headline metric, etc.) to
  render and popup without a second lookup.

The browser fetches both at startup with `Promise.all`, joins them by
ID into a Map once, and renders from memo'd selectors.

### Provenance & freshness

Civic data goes stale silently. Bake provenance into the build so the
UI can be honest about it:

- Wrap the extract output in a manifest object — `{ generatedAt:
  '2026-05-20T14:00:00Z', sources: { <sourceKey>: { dataset:
  '<id-or-url>', rowCount: 12345, lastModified: '…' }, … }, records:
  [...] }` — or write a sibling `manifest.json` alongside the data
  files. Either works; pick one and stick to it.
- Surface "Data as of *YYYY-MM-DD*" in the title block and again in the
  data-source popover. Make it unmissable.
- The extract step should fail loudly on schema surprises: assert
  expected columns exist, row counts are in a sane range, and at least
  N% of records geocoded by the direct or parent-PIN methods. A silent
  null-flood is worse than a failed build.

## UX

The goal is a visitor who has never seen the site understanding the
headline finding within ten seconds.

### Lead with the summary

- Two large KPIs above the fold: an **average** and a **median**
  (medians blunt outliers in skewed civic distributions — show both).
- A grouped summary **table** below the KPIs that breaks the population
  down two complementary ways (e.g. by neighborhood and by category)
  with a toggle. Keep totals live: any filter change updates KPIs,
  table, and map together.
- Define currency/percent/number formatters once in a shared module
  and reuse them in the map popup, table, and KPI cards so every
  surface agrees to the dollar. Make them tolerant of `null` and
  return a consistent sentinel (`—`).

### Loading, empty, and error states

The three JSON fetches are the longest critical-path operation in the
app. Spec each visible state, don't ship a white screen:

- **Loading**: render the chrome immediately — sidebar shell, KPI
  cards as skeleton blocks, map container with the basemap tiles
  already drawing. Avoid a centered spinner on a blank page; the
  basemap alone gives the visitor a sense of place while data
  arrives.
- **Partial load**: don't block the map on the geometry file if the
  records file is already in hand — draw point markers first, then
  swap to parcel polygons when the geometry arrives. Progressive
  rendering beats a synchronized but slower paint.
- **Empty filter result**: when the active filters select zero
  records, the table and KPIs read the null-display sentinel (`—`)
  and a single-button "Reset filters" appears inline. Don't silently
  show a blank map.
- **Fetch failure**: catch the `Promise.all` rejection and render an
  error card in place of the KPIs with the upstream URL, the HTTP
  status, and a "Retry" button. Link to the data-source popover so
  the visitor can verify the underlying portal is up.

### Fluid map interactions

- **Cluster, then expand**: when many records share a parcel or
  coordinate, draw one polygon/circle whose color is the
  *base-weighted* aggregate. Click expands the cluster into a
  sunflower of offset points — place children around the center on a
  golden-angle (~137.5°) spiral with a radius that grows with
  `sqrt(index)`, so points don't overlap and the layout is
  deterministic — and individual units become selectable.
- **Color-coded legend that filters**: legend swatches are buttons.
  Clicking one isolates that bin on the map *without* changing the
  summary totals — visitors can probe "where are the 50%+ increases?"
  without losing the denominator.
- **Smooth highlight**: search-selected records pan the map and draw a
  ring + dot in a dedicated Leaflet pane stacked above markers, so
  the chosen record stands out without flashing or bouncing.
- **Canvas renderer**: use Leaflet's canvas renderer (`L.canvas({
  pane: 'markers' })`) on a dedicated marker pane to keep tens of
  thousands of points responsive on mobile.

### Tooltips & help

- Marker tooltips on clusters explain *what* and *how* — "N units, X% to
  Y%. Click to expand." Don't leave the visitor guessing what a circle
  represents.
- Provide an always-visible `?` info button that opens a popover with:
  every data source's portal URL and a one-line description, the
  "Data as of *YYYY-MM-DD*" stamp from the manifest, a frank
  disclosure of known gaps (e.g. "~7% of properties lack coordinates
  and aren't shown on the map"), and the source license/attribution
  text where required. Trust is built by being explicit about the
  seams.
- Hover tooltips on truncated text use the native `title` attribute so
  full class descriptions and neighborhood codes are reachable without
  resizing the panel.

### URL-serialized state

Treat the URL as the source of truth for *view* state so a visitor can
copy the address bar and a colleague sees exactly the same map:

- Serialize selected classes, selected neighborhoods, selected legend
  bins, group-by mode, highlighted record ID, and (optionally) map
  center/zoom into search params (`?class=202,203&nbhd=…&bins=gte50&
  group=class&pin=…`). Use short keys; comma-separate values.
- On load, hydrate the Zustand store from `location.search` before the
  first render so the initial paint matches the link.
- On every relevant state change, debounce a `history.replaceState`
  (not `pushState`, to keep the back button useful) that writes the new
  URL. Don't fire on every keystroke in the search box — only commit
  the highlighted ID.
- **Per-record permalink**: `?pin=…` (or whatever the canonical ID is)
  is a first-class entry point. On hydrate, look the record up, pan
  the map to it, draw the highlight ring, and open the popup
  automatically — no extra click. This is the link visitors actually
  share ("here's my property") and it costs almost nothing once URL
  state is already wired.
- Provide a "Share this view" button that copies the current URL, and
  a separate "Share this record" affordance inside the marker popup
  that copies a `?pin=…` permalink — two distinct sharing intents.

### Animations

- Use `tw-animate-css` for short, functional transitions: drawer slide,
  chevron rotate, popover fade. Keep durations ≤200ms — civic data
  apps should feel taut, not playful.
- Animate the map (`map.setView`) and the marker highlight; never
  animate KPI numbers (it makes them harder to read).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — wrap non-essential transitions in
  a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` block.

## Testing

This shape of app — data extraction plus visual rendering — doesn't
reward heavy unit coverage. Aim for **tripwires, not coverage**:

- **Extract snapshot test**: hold a small fixture DB (or recorded
  API responses) under `test/fixtures/`, run the extract script
  against it, and snapshot the `records.json` + `geometry.geojson`
  outputs. Any upstream schema drift or extract-logic regression
  shows up as a diff in the next PR. Cheap, durable, catches the bug
  class that matters most.
- **Join-coverage assertion**: as part of the extract, assert that
  ≥X% of records resolve via the direct or parent-ID method (aim
  for ≥90% in production). Fail the build if it drops — silent
  geocoding decay is a real failure mode.
- **Boot smoke test**: a single Playwright (or Vitest + jsdom)
  scenario that loads the app against the committed fixtures, waits
  for the KPI cards to render real values, opens the data-source
  popover, and selects a legend bin. If this passes, the wiring is
  intact.
- **Pure-function unit tests** for the math that drives the headline
  numbers — the median calculator, the base-weighted aggregate
  percent calculator, the legend-bin classifier, and the
  coordinate-resolver fallback chain. These are the functions that,
  if quietly wrong, would mislead every visitor.
- **Visual regression**: optional but worthwhile — a Playwright
  screenshot of the map at a fixed zoom + filter set, gated to
  re-baseline only on intentional UI changes.

Skip: exhaustive component tests, integration tests against live
upstream APIs (flaky, no signal), and snapshot tests of JSX trees
(noise).
